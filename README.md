# SurrogateModel_MOF_Mechanical_Stability

Data and scripts for predicting the mechanical properties of MOFs

## Install

Note: This packages is tested on the Linux and mac. We recommended using Linux or Mac for implementing scripts.

## Download the datasets

- You can download the datasets in [my figshare link](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24316339).
- All the CIF files and features that we utilized in our study can be found in the above link.\
- We recommend not changing the configuration of the folders.

## Scripts

* OptimalSurrogateKVRH.ipynb and OptimalSurrogateGVRH.ipynb contains the results of benchmarking.

* Trainingsize.ipynb files contains the results of the robustness of each descriptor in terms of training size.
